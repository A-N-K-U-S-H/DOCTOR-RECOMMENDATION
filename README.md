# Initial Setup and Data Loading

The code starts by importing necessary libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn modules.
%matplotlib inline is a magic command that allows plotting in Jupyter notebooks.
The code imports tools for working with CSV files, generating random numbers, and computing cosine similarity.
TfidfVectorizer and linear_kernel are imported for text vectorization and computing the linear kernel.
The code also imports the Google Colab files module to upload files.

# Data Preprocessing

The code defines input and output file paths for a dataset.
It reads an existing CSV file (datasetmed.csv), adds random integers to each row, and writes the modified data to a new CSV file (output1.csv).

# Data Analysis and Feature Engineering

The code creates dictionaries to store doctor ratings and patient counts.

It calculates cosine similarity between doctor ratings using scikit-learn's cosine_similarity function.

The code normalizes patient counts and ratings to a common scale.

# Trust Factor Calculation

The code calculates a trust factor for each doctor using a combination of cosine similarity, patient counts, and ratings.

The calculated trust factors are added to the DataFrame as a new column.

# Specialty Analysis

The code organizes the DataFrame by specialization, extracts data for a particular specialization (e.g., Cardiology), and sorts the data by trust factor in descending order. It displays all the doctors of a particular specification.


# Data Cleaning and Scaling

The code drops rows with missing values in specific columns.
The code uses scikit-learn's StandardScaler to scale the 'Trust Factor' column.

# Collaborative Filtering

The code creates a user-doctor matrix using Pandas' pivot_table.
It splits the data into training and testing sets and computes doctor similarities using cosine similarity.

# K-Nearest Neighbors

It defines the number of neighbors (k) for the K-nearest neighbors model and fits the model to the doctor similarities.

The code demonstrates how to get top doctor recommendations for a specific doctor using the K-nearest neighbors model.
